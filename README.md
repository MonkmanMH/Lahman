## Current Version

This is the R version of the 2020 edition of Sean Lahman's Baseball Database, http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/.

* A notable change is that the old `Master` table, has been renamed `People` in the
Lahman Database. To avoid breaking old scripts or examples, the `People` table
has been copied to `Master`. In the next annual release, it is **very likely** that `Master`
will be removed.

* A collection of vignettes has been added, illustrating various data manipulation
tasks and analyses to explore some baseball questions.  Try: `browseVignettes("Lahman")`

* In addition, the documentation
has been updated to use `dplyr` and `tidyr` tools for database manipulation and `ggplot2` for plots.

## Installation

For the current CRAN version, simply use:

    install.packages("Lahman")

If you wish to use a non-release version of `Lahman`, use `dev_mode()`.

    dev_mode()
    install_github("cdalzell/Lahman", ref="insert_branch_name_here")
    #  ...test ...
    dev_mode()  # revert to previous
